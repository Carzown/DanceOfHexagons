                    <div class="geometry-text">
                        <p>Bees are highly important pollinators that support about 90% of flowering plant species and about 75% of the world's leading food crops. Unfortunately, they face many threats from habitat loss, pesticides, climate change, and invasive species. As highly social organisms, worker bees forage not only for nectar and pollen but also for water and resin, which support colony energy, nutrition, cooling, and antimicrobial defense.</p>
                        <p>Bees communicate through the waggle dance, a precise figure-eight performed on the vertical comb where the waggle angle, relative to vertical/sun, encodes direction, and the waggle duration does distance. Despite this precision, hive structure and dance communication are often studied in parallel rather than together. Comb geometry irregularities, due to various stressors or artificial hive designs, may influence the accuracy of communication and forager recruitment.</p>
                        <p>Using modern computational geometry and vision - Voronoi and Delaunay constructions and vector analysis. The structure of combs can be quantified (angles, spacing, alignment) and compared with behavior to reveal overlooked effects on colony performance and to inform applied beekeeping and crop pollination strategies.</p>
